Q: Do I need any installed software or plugins to run QuickGrapher?
A: No, QuickGrapher is built from the ground up to run directly in the browser. No installed software or third party plugins are necessary. You do not need Flash, Shockwave, or any other plugin. Quickgrapher is a pure Javascript and HTML5 application, technologies which are built into modern browsers.
